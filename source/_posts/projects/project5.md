Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have languished under the name of this man: Harvey Dent.

Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?

Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body or your life. That time is past.

I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.

I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members in the Wayne family.

You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.

Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

I am the League of Shadows.

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

That's a lovely lovely voice!
